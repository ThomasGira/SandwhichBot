# Sandwhich Bot
## Intro
The Sandwhich Bot was the culmination of my computer science robotics controll class and was a project I worked on with a team of 3 to develop a robot that can assemble sandwiches. For this project I developed all of the forward kinematics and decision making code. I was able to simplify a 9 DOF robotic arm so it was better suited for our application. Learning all of the derivations and logic for this project was very interesting and it was my first time truly collaboratively working on code with others.

## My Role
For this project I was in charge of all of the forward kinematics as well as the decision making aspects of the robot. My other teammates worked on the world environment and the safety detection features. This project was a cool experience because I was able to learn the controls of a robotic arm. The System was reduced to a 3 DOF robotic arm with the majority of the controls via a 2 DOF system governed as such:

Certain action required the rest of the joint to operate in different formats and were not controlled by a typical set forward kineatic equations.

### Note on git
I worked on this project before I started working in git so theres not any legacy files.
